Description
===========
This is project Image Caption developed by team Go Duck composed of 
Benxiang Yan, Chenwei Dai, Dongyang Zhang, Wenmiao Yu

Requirements
============
        1.pip3 install -r requirements.txt

        2.pip3 install --user pycocotools

        3.Follow the steps to install cocoapi:
          git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git
          cd cocoapi/PythonAPI
          make
        
        4.git clone https://github.com/salaniz/pycocoevalcap

Code organization
=================
Demo/       --  Run a demo of our code (for comparing small vocabulary model and large vocabulary model mainly)

Data/
1.Download cocodataset and make sure the iamges are in './data/images', and annotations are in './data/annotations'

2.Follow the following steps if you need split the data (you may need change the directories or proportions)
cd ./data
python3 split_data.py
python3 filter_annotations.py

Evaluation/
evaluation_generate_result.ipynb                         -- Generate the result json files
                                                         -- Make sure you copy everything in 'Train/' here except the training notebook, including the vocabulary.pkl generated after training
small_evaluation_val.ipynb, large_evaluation_test.ipynb  -- Generate the evaluation scores, make sure you put them in './pycocoevalcap/'
plot.ipynb                                               -- Plot the loss graphs

Train/
small_vocab_training.ipynb                               -- Train for small vocabulary model
                                                         -- Make sure you set the right directories in 'data_loader.py'
                                                         -- The other training for big vocabulary is different in data set and epoch, refer our report for details
